	My favourite national leader is MAHATMA GANDHI, He was born in Porbandar. He got primary education of Porbandar and Secondary education of Rajkot. Than he gone out of country and He studied law also and practiced in India. He is maker of our this modern India. He done great job of uniting peoples of India to fight against social evils like un-touchability. Gandhi belived in truth and non-violance and that's why the nation honoured as Father Of India.
