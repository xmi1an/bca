<about>
<p>I am Purushottam Singh, I am Convener of Student Front of Gujarat Parivartan Party, Himtnagar and I am student of D.L.Institiute of Management and Technology, BCA College. I am studying in this field because all the subjects of this field are too interesting and favourite.</p>
<p>Overall the thing is that, that I am technical student. I am also interested in Driving.. but I dont have Driving licence still ;-). Not also this but I also interested in law and studied it little deeply.</p>
<p>My family is too short and sweet also.. My father is Advocate and District Treasurer of GPP, My mother is marvellous tutor and from childhood she teached me and result of her teaching is whatever I am right now. I also have one little bro, who is studiying in 11th.. Allthough he is good painter. And we all live together with joy & affection in our sweet home at Himatnagar.</p></about>
