	I like all teachers of my college but out of them all my favourite teacher is Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh is healthy and smart. He always talk with us sweetly. He teaches us HTML. He has very effective and easy method to teach us.
	
	He helps us if we have any problem. In short, Mr. Singh is not only our teacher but our friend, philosopher & guide also.</p></font>
